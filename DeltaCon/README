======================= Problem Definition ===============================
Given: two graphs on the same set of nodes, and different edge sets
Find:  their similarity, i.e. a number in [0,1], 
        where 0 means that the graphs are completely dissimilar, and 
              1 means that they are identical.
==========================================================================



** OUTPUTS OF THE ALGORITHM: **
>> DeltaCon similarity score, 
>> the standard deviation of the DeltaCon score 
      (non-zero for the approximate algorithm, DeltaCon, 
	   0 for the exact algorithm, DeltaCon0)
>> the runtime, as well as 
>> the standard deviation of the time 
	  (non-zero for the approximate algorithm, DeltaCon, 
	   0 for the exact algorithm, DeltaCon0)
